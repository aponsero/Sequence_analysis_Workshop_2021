# Sequence_analysis_Workshop_2021
KEYS workshop: what can we learn from a single sequence?

## Workshop overview and objectives
This workshop aims to present a brief introduction to important concepts in DNA sequence analysis. Most importantly, this workshop covers:

	- Sequence similarity
	- Global and local sequence alignment
	- ORF detection
	- Detection of Horizontal Gene Transfert events

The hands-on part of the workshop gives an introduction to:

	- BlastN and BlastP
	- heuristic ORF finder
	- Research and download from the NCBI Entrez portal
